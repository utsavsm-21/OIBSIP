Project Overview 
The objective of this project is to develop an online examination system that allows users to securely log in, attempt multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and manage their profile, all within a timed environment. The system ensures smooth session management and automatic submission of answers when the time expires.

Steps Performed & Tools Used:
Created four main classes to organize the project efficiently:

Main Class – Acts as the central hub connecting all other class files.

Question Class – Displays the questions along with multiple-choice options during the exam.

Test Class – Handles the actual examination process, including the timer and auto-submit functionality.

User Class – Manages login, profile updates, and password changes.

Designed the system flow so that users can log in, attempt MCQs within a specified time, update their profiles, and log out securely.Implemented the timer to track the exam duration and auto-submit answers when the time ends.

Outcome:
The system allows users to take exams efficiently with real-time question display, time tracking, and session management. Users can update their profiles and passwords, ensuring a personalized and secure experience. The modular class design makes the project easy to maintain and extend.
